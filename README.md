Goal: Build the Google.com homepage

Outcome: The exercise took longer than expected but I am content with the result. It looks very similar to the classic Google homepage.

Lessons Learned:
In this exercise I learned a great deal about how to create a webpage using HTML and CSS. I used dev tools to deconstruct the Google homepage in order to build a basic version of the page. This became helpful when I found myself unable to find the answers I was looking for using Google. Most of the process was based on trial and error. One point of frustration came when I attempted to add the Google mic to the search bar. Despite spending a considerable amount of time on this part of the project, I was successful at getting it on the page and into the search bar but unsuccessful at getting it to stay on the right side. I also learned how to write code in CSS that references the ID or the class. This was troublesome at first until I figured out how to differentiate between the classes.
